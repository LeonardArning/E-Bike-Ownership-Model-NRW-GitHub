Cells_elevar.ipynb
Python code which computes the elvar attribute for 1km-Gridcells.
Uses the GeoGitter Inspire (https://gdz.bkg.bund.de/index.php/default/geographische-gitter-fur-deutschland-in-lambert-projektion-geogitter-inspire.html) and a dataset provided exclusively by Jan Kuchh√§user, Chair of Freight Transport Planning and Transport Logistics, University of Wuppertal.
Generates a csv-file with the elevar attribute for the grid cells as well as some figures.

Cells spatial type.ipynb 
Python code which writes one of four RegioStaR spatial types to 1km-grid cells.
Uses the output from cells_elevar, the GeoGitter Inspire (for 250m cells with municipality code) and the RegioStaR dataset (www.bmvi.de/regiostar)
Generates a csv-file with the spatial type attribute for the grid cells as well as some figures.

Data processing Ownership.ipynb
Python code which combines the B3 MiD person data with the elevar and spatial type data and processes it (clean data, create dummies etc.)
Generates a csv-file with all person-level observations and the dependent and explanatory variables

MiD Ownership Logit.ipynb
Python code using Biogeme (https://transp-or.epfl.ch/documents/technicalReports/Bier23.pdf) to estimate a multinomial Logit model.

MiD Ownership mvProbit R.ipynb
R code using mvProbit (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mvProbit/index.html) to estimate a multivariate Probit model.
